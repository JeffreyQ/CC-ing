## Data exports

With help from volunteers like yourself, we are extracting structured, building-level information from numerous books contained in Powell Library at UCLA. Of course, the ultimate goal is to make this data publicly available. Having a keyword-searchable and structured index of attributes will be of great use to anyone exploring our data sources.

After enough transcriptions are made, our team will determine the best way to get the data to you in an easy and accessible way.
